## If statements

```python
programmer = True

if programmer is True:
    print ('You are awesome')
```
  
  
```python
is_programmer = False

if is_programmer:
    print('You are awesome')
else:
    print('You are not awesome. Learn some programming!')
```
  

```python
is_programmer = False
is_awesome = True 

if is_programmer:
    print('You are the best!')
elif is_awesome:
    print('You are not the best. but still awesome.')
else:
    print ('Be awesome!')
```

> As a recap, here's what we can do:  
> ``if is_programmer is True:``  
> `` if is_programmer is not True:``  
> `` if is_programmer:`` 
> `` if is_programmer is False:``  
> `` if not is_programmer:``  
> ``else:``

## ``bool()`` built-in function

Python has built-in functions such as ``int()``  to convert things to ``integers`` (whole numbers).  

Python also has a built-in function called ``bool()`` , used to convert things to ``Booleans`` (``True``/``False`` values).

In if statements, what happens is that the condition  is inside a bool() . Essentially something like this:

```python
if bool(is_programmer is False) is True:
    <block>
```

So:

``if 5:``  becomes ``if bool(5) is True:`` 

And:

``if 'hello, world!':``  becomes ``if bool('hello, world!') is True:``

That ensures that we're always comparing apples to apples, and not apples to oranges.

The ``bool()``  function gives us ``True``  for most things (e.g. ``bool('hello, world!')``  gives us ``True``). It only returns ``False`` for a couple things, like:

> ``bool(0)``  
> ``bool(0.0)``  
> ``bool('')  # empty string``  
> ``bool(None)``  
> ``bool([])  # empty list``  
> And a few others. Hope this clears some things up!
