## sending emails with smtplib

```python
"""
If you gt an SMTPAuthenticationError even when yor password is correct,
it is possible that you have 2-factor authentication enabled.
You'll need to use an App Password to log in instead of you normal password

If you donÂ¡t have 2-fa anabled, you will have to allow access by less secure apps in your Gmail security
preferences-thought remember to deactivate it once you've finished learning about sendinge-mails with python
"""
